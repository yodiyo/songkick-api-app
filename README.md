Interacting with Songkick API to populate Google spreadsheets for artists and bands

Working version - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TzqxscE8VWWvdTBpJeh6aqxrmWcliDg4xR6DmHaUi68/edit?usp=sharing - add an artist and get a list of their gigs

Still to do: Songkick only allows 50 gigs at a time, so need to work out a formula to calculate number of pages and loop through them to publish all gigs.
